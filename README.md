## Background and Overview
GumBall Attack is a simple arcade game with basic controls. The gameplay involves controlling a character left or right while dodging bouncing giant gumballs. The character can also shoot projectiles straight up, which on impact with a gumball will split the gumball into two smaller gumballs.

Although a seemingly easy concept, GumBall Attack becomes more difficult as there are more bouncing gumballs.

The inspiration for GumBall Attack comes a game called Bubble Struggle, which I played countless times for hours as a kid.
