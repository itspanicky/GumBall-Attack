# GumBall Attack

## Background and Overview
GumBall Attack is a simple game with basic controls. The gameplay involves controlling a character left or right while dodging bouncing giant gumballs. The character can also shoot projectiles straight up, which on impact with a gumball will split the gumball into two smaller gumballs.

Although a seemingly easy concept, GumBall Attack becomes more difficult as there are more bouncing gumballs.

The inspiration for GumBall Attack comes a game called Bubble Struggle, which I played countless times for hours as a kid.

## Functionality and MVP
- Users can press left/right arrow keys to most in that direction.
- Circles (gumballs) will bounce within the border of the game.
- Gumballs will split into two smaller gumballs when it collides with a projectile
- The game ends when all lives are lost and a life is lost when a gumball collides with the player.
